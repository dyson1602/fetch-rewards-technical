## App

App fetches data from a remote API and sorts it by category after filtering out nameless entries.

## Comments

Certain aspects of the components, such as the buttons, could be refactored into their own components to make it more modular. For the sake of this assessment I chose to keep everything a bit more central so it's easy to follow.

I used SASS instead of plain CSS since the job description mentions it, and it will be easier to adjust styles were the component to be used differently. Colors were selected from the Fetch Rewards homepage via a color picker.
